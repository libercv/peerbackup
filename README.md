==========

Distributed encrypted backups between peers. 

First things first: what to expect
===================================
This is a learning project. My goal is to learn about cryptography, communications and filesystems. It may take really long before any part of the code is minimally useful.
Due to the nature of the project, i'm afraid source code is going to have to be rewritten many times as i learn and change my mind about what's a sensible solution. Let's call it an evolutive project. (Evolutive as in 'i don't have a clue about what's it going to look like a week from now')
In order to make the process less painful tools that improve performance are going to be needed, so i have chosen to write it in Go (Golang) and use Git as control version system.

Ok, ok, so... what's this about?
================================
Encrypted remote redundant data backup. I don't want to trust my personal files to any company. I could have used rsync with duplicity or any other solution, but they don't quite are what i need. Besides, learning is the primary goal.

Is collaboration welcome?
=========================
Of course! Collaboration, help, guidance...

Want to know more?
==================
I'm setting up a blog (http://peerbackup.blogspot.com) that will contain information about the project.
